    Handle LLM06: Excessive Agency vulnerability.

    This endpoint demonstrates excessive agency vulnerabilities in AI systems.
    1. Excessive Functionality
        An LLM agent has access to extensions which include functions that are not needed for the intended operation of the system. For example, a developer needs to grant an LLM agent the ability to read documents from a repository, but the 3rd-party extension they choose to use also includes the ability to modify and delete documents.

    Minimize extensions:
    Limit the extensions that LLM agents are allowed to call to only the minimum necessary. For example, if an LLM-based system does not require the ability to fetch the contents of a URL then such an extension should not be offered to the LLM agent.
